          <span>
            In the past, CSS float properties were one of the main methods for
            arranging elements on a website. And if you’ve ever worked that way,
            you know that it’s not always ideal for complex layouts. Luckily in
            the modern era of web design, aligning elements has become much more
            streamlined thanks to Flexbox and CSS grids.</span>
            <br />
            <span>Flexbox came along, it made alignment much easier and has since
            been widely adopted. CSS Grid Layouts have also created a lot of
            excitement in the web design community. Awhile back, we took a look
            at how to create a basic CSS Grid Layout. Although it is not widely
            adopted, browsers are starting to adopt support for it. When it is
            fully supported, this will have a great impact on designs. Browser
            support is increasing all the time; be sure to check out Can I Use
            for the most up to date information.</span>
            <br />
            <span>you may be wondering what’s next; after all, Flexbox and CSS
            Grid Layouts seem to accomplish similar results. It’s not a Flexbox
            versus Grid debate, however, but more of learning how to use them
            together. The more I’ve played around with both Grid and Flexbox,
            I’ve found that you don’t have to choose just one or the other. In
            the near future, when CSS Grid Layouts have full browser support,
            designers will be able to take the combined advantages of each and
            create the most efficient and interesting designs.</span>
            <br />
            <span>CSS grid works best for more complicated layouts. Think of CSS grid
            as a way to anchor multiple elements onto a page. Grid is practical
            for layouts that have multiple blocks of content and images that you
            need to organize. Flexbox isn’t as useful for these more involved
            layouts, because it only lets you control how the elements are
            arranged in a single direction.</span>
            <br />
            <span>Of course CSS grid and flexbox can work together in a layout. You
            can use flexbox inside CSS grid and vice versa. For instance, you
            could use flexbox to center an element like a button both vertically
            and horizontally within a particular grid cell (since centering with
            other CSS methods is … tricky). And you could also flip this
            scenario, using grid to control the placement of data within cards
            whose layout is determined, at a higher level, by flexbox. This can
            be really handy for combining the flexibility of flexbox with the
            precision of grid for cards that contain a wealth of data, such as
            you might need for real estate listings.</span>
            <br />

              I have over 6 years of experience as a software engineer, and have
              worked at both small startups and large organizations. While I'm a
              proficient full-stack developer, my expertise is in building
              scalable backend services (API services, stream processing, and
              async mechanisms).
              <br />
              I love building things. While hard engineering problems are often
              intrinsically fun to tackle, I'm most attracted to solving real
              customer problems with a business justification. I'm looking for a
              senior individual contributor role where I can take on on
              collaborative team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience
              with architecture and project management.
